##TITLE:
Parts of Speech Counter.

##OBJECTIVE:
To count the Parts of Speech in a given text by comparing it with a dictionary.

##TOPIC IDEA:
We will take some text as an input from the user through the command line or by reading a text file and count the parts of speech present in the text. For this, we will break the text into words and then we will compare each word with the predefined arrays of verbs, nouns and adjectives etc.We will initialize a counter variable that will increase if the word will match to any element of the array. At the end, we will print the total number of different parts of speech found in the given text.
